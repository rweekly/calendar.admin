Welcome to the R Weekly Curator Calendar app. The goal of this app is to provide
a simple interface for you to either decline a future issue's curation, or to
propose switching one of your future issue curations with another curator on the
team. You can view the web version of the calendar at [rweekly.github.io/rweekly-calendar/](https://rweekly.github.io/rweekly-calendar/).

To initiate a proposed decline or switch, select the **Table** view of the
curation schedule and select the row with the issue you are not able to curate.
Then press either the **Decline Curation** or **Propose Curation Switch** button
as appropriate.
