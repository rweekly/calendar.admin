  R-Weekly Curation Calendar Admin App
</h1>

This repository contains a Shiny application for the R Weekly team of curators to manage their schedule curation windows. Once a curator logs in to the application using their R Weekly Slack channel account, they can either decline a future curation or propose to switch one of their future curation windows with another member of the team. The application automatically sends a message to the R Weekly Slack channel, ensuring the team is aware of the decline or proposed switch of a curation window.

> R Weekly was founded on May 20, 2016. R is growing very quickly, and there are lots of great blogs, tutorials and other formats of resources coming out every day. R Weekly wants to keep track of these great things in the R community and make it more accessible to everyone.

The R-Weekly team is composed of volunteers who are passionate about the R community. Each R-Weekly issue is assigned a curator who edits the issue content, launches an internal poll for team voting of the top highlights, and publishes the issue. Additional details on the curation process can be found on the [Release Editor FAQ](https://github.com/rweekly/rweekly.org/wiki/Release-Editor-FAQ). The team would welcome new curators! You can learn more about joining the team from the project [README](https://github.com/rweekly/rweekly.org#join-us).
